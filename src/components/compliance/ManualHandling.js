    <strong>
      We are all exposed at times to some form of manual handling such as lifting, 
      carrying, pulling and pushing actions that can be compounded by simultaneous 
      movements such as climbing or pivoting. Personal injuries resulting from 
      incorrect manual handling in the workplace accounts for over one million working 
      days lost per year, as well as the pain and suffering experienced by the 
      casualties. Correct manual handling techniques can make a huge difference.
    </strong>

    <p>
      The risks arising from manual handling have been recognised by the Health and 
      Safety Executive for many years, as evidenced in their regulations and advisory 
      activities promoting good practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Regulations require employers to provide their employees with health and 
      safety information and training – supplemented, as necessary, with more specific 
      information and training on manual handling injury risks and prevention.
    </p>  
    

    <p>
      This course provides an ideal approach to safer and more effective manual handpng 
      – not only meeting HSE recommendations, but also promoting good and safe practices 
      in any situation.
