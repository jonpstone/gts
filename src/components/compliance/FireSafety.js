    <strong>
      You will, no doubt, be well aware of the potentially devastating effects of fires 
      in the workplace in terms of lives lost, injuries, damage to property and the 
      environment, and to business continuity. You may also be aware that it is believed 
      that most fires are preventable. The importance of fire safety in the workplace is 
      underpinned by health and safety legislation that places a duty on employers to 
      establish policies and procedures and ensure their employees receive appropriate 
      training.
    </strong>

    <strong>
      This Fire Safety Training Course is designed for employees who want to develop 
      their basic fire safety awareness in order to assist their employer by undertaking 
      more specific fire safety roles in the workplace to manage fire risk (e.g. as fire 
      wardens/marshals/stewards etc.) Successful candidates will be awarded a national 
      level 2 qualification (Level 5 in Scotland).
