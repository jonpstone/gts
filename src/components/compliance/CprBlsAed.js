    <p>
      Heart and circulatory disease claims around 200,000 lives each year. Many could 
      have been saved if a defibrillator was made available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Automated External Defibrillators (AED’s) are now becoming more common throughout 
      a range of public and work places. A casualty’s survival rate will dramatically 
      increase if an AED is available and if you have appropriately qualified personnel 
      to use it.

      This very practical course will enable your learners to use the AED competently 
      and with confidence.
