      <strong>Safeguarding is how we can protect children, young people and vulnerable
        adults from abuse or neglect by the actions, or lack of actions, of another 
        person. In order to safeguard and protect persons from abuse or neglect we need
        to learn how to identify vulnerable individuals and take necessary steps to stop
        abuse and neglect.

    <p>
      Everyone has the right to be safe and live without the fear of abuse, neglect 
      or exploitation and this course aims to teach you how to recognise the signs of
      abuse and neglect and what actions you can take to stop this from happening and 
      occurring again in the future. Abuse, neglect and exploitation can occur anywhere
      and by anyone, quite often being a person of trust.

    <p>
      This course is designed for all persons, no matter the field that they are
