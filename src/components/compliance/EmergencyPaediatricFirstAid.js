    This one-day Emergency Paediatric First Aid course has been designed for those who have an interest in child and infant basic life support.

    If you have a professional interest, i.e. you are a child-minder or school teacher, etc, then this course partly fulfils the requirements of Ofsted and the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). Ofsted and the Early Years Foundation Stage require you to have 12 hours of Paediatric First Aid Training, so the 2-Day Level 3 Award in Paediatric First Aid would be required to fulfil their requirements. This 6 hour qualification also makes up the first half of the 12-hour course.

    Each student will also receive a free comprehensive fully illustrated training book to supplement the Emergency Paediatric First Aid course this will be provided in your training pack.

    A maximum of 12 students are allowed and must be a minimum of 16 years of age and a certificate can be offered to all, subject to assessment.  It is the employer's responsibility to ensure that the student is suitable for that role.
