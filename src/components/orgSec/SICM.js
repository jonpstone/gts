      <h4>Why do I need this course? That’s what the Security and Emergency Services are for.</h4>
      <p>
        This country’s security and emergency services are the best in the world, and it’s a testament to that fact, that the UK have had 
        very few terror attacks in recent years. However, it is inevitable that an attack will eventually once again take place. When it 
        does, the initial response will be to neutralize the threat, not treating casualties.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is vital that HIGH RISK targets have the training and equipment in place to deter or detect possible threats before they take 
        place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Planned and Practiced emergency procedures and protocols are vital to minimise the number of casualties in the event of any terror 
        attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        When this happens, people caught up in this attack should follow the National Police Message of RUN, HIDE, TELL. You just need to 
        know how to do this the right way. Report when you are safe, Run, Hide, Barricade, Flight or Fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Serious Incident Control Measures Course will help you to make decisions under stress and give you skills to protect yourself
        and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it’s safe to do so, you will have the trauma first aid skills to treat yourself or others using the latest medical equipment 
        or emergency fashioned improvised equipment. It is well documented that those that receive immediate point of wound treatment can 
        survive even major trauma injuries.

      <h4>COURSE INTRODUCTION</h4>
      <p>
        This three day course has been developed as a guide to increase the skill set of key industries and individuals outside the national 
        emergency response agencies, in areas such as initial trauma treatment and scene management.
      </p>
      <p>
        To extend the UK’s potential first on scene capabilities to competent civilians will undoubtedly save lives by extending the 
        survivability of casualties from the point of wounding to post professional care and minimising the risk of injury by logical and 
        precise scene management.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reality is that with multi-site armed attacks and bombings across Europe, America and the world aimed at high capacity civilian 
        populace targets such as schools, stadiums, Shopping Centres and public events, the UK will inevitably be targeted once again. If 
        we can train the UK’s civilian security, academic institutions, event management organisations and others with the skills to 
        identify potential threats and the ability to plan and react to them, lives will be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have been fortunate in the UK that our security services and police have maintained such an effective operation to detect and 
        deter most threats posed to our domestic environment, however it is an eventuality that more terrorist like attacks will take 
        place in the UK. The real threat of mass casualty attacks on schools in the future is also a real and viable threat, of the like 
        seen regularly in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of any mass casualty attack or incident there will be a period that those caught up in this situation will be any 
        casualties best chance of survival.
