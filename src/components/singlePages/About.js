        Golbourn Training Solutions believes in making training fun, interactive and realistic. With our courses the dreaded mandatory 
        training is a thing of the past. We will adapt our courses around each and every learner to maximise not only their individual 
        experience but for the group as a whole. The right environment, the right atmosphere and the right instructor can get the best 
        out of everyone. 

        We make our First Aid Training scenarios as realistic as possible with the use of casualty simulation, this is not only fun and 
        realistic, but it is a crucial learning tool. When your First Aider is in an emergency situation their training and muscle memory 
        will make the difference.

        Learning is developing, developing is investing, investing is securing success for the future. 

        We aim to help make your staff the best they can be, and with our security training we will prepare you with the skills to protect
        your staff and clients.

        My name is Steve, and I’m the Managing Director of Golbourn Training Solutions and lead instructor, I started this company to not 
        only make a successful business, but to enhance a part of my character and life that I love, investing and developing other 
        people’s skills. Watching a learner go from strength to strength over a short period of time truly does motivate me.

        My background in instructing and development has been gained from 16 years’ service in the British Army, where I was a Team Medic, 
        Battlefield Casualty Drills Trainer and Small Arms Weapons Instructor. I have completed multiple operational tours and met many 
        wonderful people from all walks of life and parts of the world. The military has given me the skills to be dynamic, flexible and 
        have confidence in my holistic approach to learner development. I have a can do, will do attitude.

        The SICM - Serious Incident Control Measures Course was designed to help organisations to be able to impliment their own easy step 
        by step protection system, while ensuring the staff are as prepared and practiced as possible to deal with terror threats. Have a 
        look at our SICM page for more information, including our Lockdown Services. 

        I aim to provide competitive prices to all my courses, but Golbourn Training Solutions openly offers discounts and support to the 
        Armed Forces, Blue Light Services, Schools, Charities, Care Industries and Volunteer groups. Some of the UK's best.

        I hope you select Golbourn Training Solutions to help in your investment and development of your staff now and in the future. 
        I aim to prove compliance training can be fun.
