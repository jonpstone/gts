			<Header as='h3'>TEAM BUILDING WALKS WITH GOLBOURN TRAINING SOLUTIONS:</Header>

			<b>Walk Hadrian’s wall - Empires End. (6 days)</b>
			<p>
				A group walk to truly test the limits of your staff, 82 miles in 6 days across 
				diverse terrain, carrying our party’s own tent, equipment, food and water. 
				Although this is not for the faint hearted, the bond and team spirit your 
				staff will gain from this experience will only be matched by their sense of 
				overwhelming achievement. You will be walking in history’s footsteps, our 
				instructor guides will be informing you of the historical facts of key moments in the Walls history and events, the 
				units that manned the mile forts and where these men came from.
			</p>

			<b>Experience Hadrian’s wall - Hadrian’s Gift. (5 days)</b>
			<p>
				This adventure is far less demanding on the feet than Empires End Walk, but still a life experience never to be 
				forgotten. This 5-day event will see you and your staff mini bused around the spectacular roman museums along the 
				length off the wall, while enjoying the local hospitality from tea rooms to traditional overnight accommodation. 
				However, you won’t miss out on the iconic views of the pennines section of the wall, snaking through the cliffs and 
				see the wall tree made famous in the Kevin costner film Robin Hood the Prince of Thieves. This 21-mile walk is slow 
				time, allowing you to take in the beautiful landscapes. This event will finish with a well-deserved evening out in 
				Newcastle.
			</p>

			<b>Battlefield Tour - Battle of Edgehill. (1 day)</b>
			<p>
				This 15-mile walk will see you walk through some of the most amazing hill views the midlands has to offer, covering 
				the iconic Burton Dassett and Edgehill hills. On your travels you and your staff will learn about the murderous local 
				history of the trails as well as stop at some of the oldest Warwickshire pubs for refreshments and lunch. After 
				dinner a period dressed matter expert in the history of the Battle of Edgehill will give a detailed account from the 
				view point of which the King stood to observe the battle, detailing where the units formed and engaged each other. 
				You will also be able to handle period weapons and equipment during this talk.
			</p>
